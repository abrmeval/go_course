# What is a Go Module?
A module is Go's way of managing dependencies and organizing code. It's a collection of related Go packages that are versioned together as a single unit. Think of it as a project boundary that defines:

Your project's identity (its import path)
What version of Go it requires
What external packages it depends on
our go.mod File Explained
This line declares your module's import path - it's the unique identifier for your module. Other projects would use this path to import your code. It doesn't have to be a real website; it's just a namespace convention (often uses domain names to ensure uniqueness).

This specifies the minimum Go version required to build your module. Your code can use language features from Go 1.25.3 and earlier.
